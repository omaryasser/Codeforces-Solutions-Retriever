# Codeforces Solutions Retriever

### Overview
This can be helpful for people who want to retrieve all of their accepted Codeforces solution links.
I implemented it as I needed to collect all of my Codeforces solution links and put them on Github as you can find in [My Codeforces Solutions](https://github.com/omaryasser/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/Codeforces%20Solutions) folder.

### Usage
* **Download** and **Execute** ```Retriever``` file.
* Provide your **Codeforces Handle** when prompted.
* Done!! **Codeforces Solutions** folder should be created.
