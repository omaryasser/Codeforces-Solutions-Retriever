# Codeforces Solutions Retriever

### Overview
This can be helpful for people who want to retrieve all of their accepted codeforces solution links.
I implemented it as I needed to collect all of my codeforces solution links and put them on github as you can find in [My Codeforces Solutions](https://github.com/omaryasser/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/Codeforces%20Solutions) folder.

### Running
* **Download** ```main.exe``` file.
* Open the **terminal** and go to the directory containing **main.exe** file.
* Type ```./main.exe``` to **execute** the code.
* You will be asked for the **codeforces handle** for which the accepted solution links will be retrieved.
